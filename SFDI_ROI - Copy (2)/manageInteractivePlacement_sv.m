%manageInteractivePlacement Manage interactive placement of new graphics object.    
%   placement_aborted = manageInteractivePlacement(h_axes,h_new,placementFcn)
%   manages interactive placement of a graphics object specified by
%   h_new into an axes h_axes. placementFcn is a function provided by clients
%   that specifies how placement of a graphics object should take place.
%      
%   placementFcn is a handle to a function that expects 2 input arguments and
%   1 output argument. The function signature of placementFcn is:
%      
%       function completed = placementFcn(x_pos,y_pos)
%      
%   where x_pos and y_pos are scalars which specify the x,y position in
%   spatial coordinates where a user initially clicked. The output parameter
%   completed signals whether or not placement is completed.
%    
%   placement_aborted = manageInteractivePlacement(...,buttonUpFcn)
%   allows clients to provide a custom buttonUpFcn. The function signature of buttonUpFcn is:
%    
%   function completed = buttonUpFcn()
%    
%   By default, placement of ROIs ends on buttonUp.
